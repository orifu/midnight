# Midnight

A countdown app for the browser with no server-side logic. It's in production [on my website](https://orifu.net/midnight/).

## Why?

Here's an explanation from when I made the first version of this:

> it's meant to be the kind of thing you look at alone at 11:49pm in a depressed sleep state where all the lights are off and you want something to look at but it can't be a video or something because the happier it is the sadder you'll get and you need SOMETHING to look at so you don't fall asleep crying so you watch the countdown and it reminds you that while today may have been bad, tomorrow will be different

The legacy version I made back then is [on my website too](https://orifu.net/archive/midnight/decide/).

## How do I get it to work?

This project uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/). You could probably get away with using another Node package manager, though.

Installing dependencies:
```console
$ pnpm i
```

Debugging:
```console
$ pnpm dev
```

Building:
```console
$ pnpm build
```
